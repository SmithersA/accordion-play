			<p>He has eaten me out of house and home.  Yes, so please your Majesty. I <em>did</em> go between them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad for her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what.  Dear master, I can go no further. <strong>O, I die for food!</strong> Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.   But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time; If <em>ever</em> you have look'd on better days, If <em>ever</em> been where bells have knoll'd to church, If <em>ever</em> sat at any good man's feast, If <em>ever</em> from your eyelids wip'd a tear, And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be; In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword. </p>

			<p>It is meat and drink to me to see a clown:  That's meat and drink to me, now.  No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one. To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues. It is my only suit, Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise.  All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.  ut were I not the better part made mercy, I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge, thou present. </p>

			<p>Nay, but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure. If he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off; I overheard him and his practices.   Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this, That your poor friends must woo your company?  What, you look merrily! As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. </p></p>

			<p>The King's a beggar, now the play is done. Nay, but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.  Kingdoms are clay;  Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler? No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.   Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this, That your poor friends must woo your company?  What, you look merrily! And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lin'd, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part.  Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious.  I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism. </p>

			<p>Neither a borrower or a lender be.  I will wear my heart upon my sleeve  Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad for her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what.  Those his goodly eyes, That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn, The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I.  Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. </p>

			<p>I have not slept one wink.  Brevity is the soul of wit.  Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir; The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for, And he shall surety me. Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.  Kingdoms are clay;  You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge. </p>

			<p>It was Greek to me.  But this denoted a foregone conclusion:  Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me; Leave me alone to woo him.  To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques. But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time; If ever you have look'd on better days, If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church, If ever sat at any good man's feast, If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear, And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be; In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword. </p>

			<p>Something wicked this way comes.  To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!  To the which place a poor sequest'red stag, That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt, Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting; and the big round tears Cours'd one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool, Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears. But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree That cannot so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.   More, more, I prithee, more. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. </p>

			<p>Neither a borrower or a lender be.  He has eaten me out of house and home.  To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!  To the which place a poor sequest'red stag, That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt, Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting; and the big round tears Cours'd one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool, Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd? Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
