			<ul>
			  <li>To create a diagram, use any drawing tool.</li>





			  <li>Don't use images of text, code samples, or terminal output. Use actual

			  <li>For diagrams (architectural drawings, flow diagrams, and so on, as

			sharp when you zoom in on the image. If you don't have an SVG file, then
			save your image as a PNG file unless you have a good reason to use a
			different format.</li>



			  <li>Make your screenshots of windows look like real windows, usually windows
			from a recent version of macOS unless there's a good reason to use a different
			operating system. For example, include the window's title bar in the screenshot.
			And if a given window has a drop shadow, then include the drop shadow in the
			screenshot as well.</li>
			  <li><p>Don't include personally identifying information (PII) in

			    <p>If a source screenshot includes PII, hide it with a solid-color overlay

			    <p>If you're exporting an image to a format that can include information on
			separate layers (for example, PDF or TIFF), flatten the image on export.</p>

			  <li>Don't use image maps. Instead, provide a list of text references following the image. Reasons
			  to avoid image maps include the following:</li>
			  <ul>
			    <li>Image maps are problematic for accessibility.</li>
			    <li>Browser implementation for image maps varies, and image maps might not function correctly on

			<p>There are differences between alt text, figure captions, and figure
			descriptions. Independently of these elements, an introductory sentence should precede most images.
			The sentence can end with a colon or a period; usually a colon if it immediately precedes the image,
			usually a period if there's more material (such as a note paragraph) between the introduction and
			the image. Always introduce an image with a complete sentence. You don't need to introduce
			screenshots that immediately follow procedural text that describes a UI.</p>

			<dl>
			  <dt>Alt text</dt>
			  <dd>A concise description of the image that can replace the image in
			situations where the image isn't visible, such as people using screen
			readers, people using text-only browsers, or people who have a low-bandwidth
			internet connection. Alt text should consider the context of the image, not just its content.

			  <dt>Figure description</dt>
			  <dd>A textual representation of the figure. In other words, the information
			that is conveyed in the image is captured in the text. A figure description
			provides detailed information about what an image is trying to convey.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Figure captions are optional. When using the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a>&gt;</code>

			<h3 id="alt-text" data-text="Alt text">Alt text</h3>
			<p>As shown in the preceding example, use an <code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#alt" class="external">alt</a></code>
			attribute to provide a text alternative for the image in context. Alt text is used by
			assistive technologies, such as screen readers, and might appear if the image
			cannot load. However, if the image is decorative (not informative) or it's
			provided only as a visual aid for information that is already expressed in text,
			then provide empty alternative text (<code translate="no" dir="ltr">alt=""</code>) so it will be ignored
			by assistive technologies.</p>
			<p>When using the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">&lt;img&gt;</code> element, the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">alt</code> attribute is required,
			even if its assigned value is an empty string (<code translate="no" dir="ltr">alt=""</code>). If you exclude the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">alt</code>
			attribute completely, then screen readers might instead read the filename aloud.
			The presence of <code translate="no" dir="ltr">alt</code> attributes helps support
			<a href="https://web.dev/labels-and-text-alternatives/#include-text-alternatives-for-images-and-objects">navigability</a>
			in screen readers, <a href="https://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#validation_basics">markup validation</a>,
			and <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184#usealtattribute">search engine optimization</a>.</p>
			<p>As per the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/images.html#general-guidelines" class="external">HTML
			specification</a>, "the most general rule to consider when writing alternative
			text is the following: the intent is that replacing every image with the text of
			its <code translate="no" dir="ltr">alt</code> attribute not change the meaning of the page." So if the
			alternative text is redundant with surrounding text or it's not useful to
			visually impaired readers, use the empty tag.</p>
			<p>Consider the following when writing alt text:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Don't include phrases like <i>Image of</i> or <i>Photo of</i>.</li>
			  <li>Include punctuation. When screen readers encounter punctuation, they
			pause before continuing.</li>
			  <li>Use consistent alt text for repeated instances of an image, such as
			controls, status indicators, or icons that appear multiple times in your
			document.</li>
			  <li>When possible, avoid using all-caps in alt text. Some screen readers read
			capital letters as each letter individually.</li>
			  <li>Introduce diagrams in the text, not in the alt text.</li>
			  <li>Don't use figure captions to replace alt text.</li>
			  <li>Use full sentences.</li>
			  <li>For reasons related to search engine optimization, keep alt text length to 155 characters
			    or less.</li>
			  <li>If the image presents more useful information than you can fit in the 155 character limit,
			include a brief summary of the image in the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">alt</code>attribute and also include the
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">longdesc</code> attribute to link to a more extensive description of the image. The
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">longdesc</code> attribute value should be a link, not text.</li>
			  <li>Alt text should consider the context of the image, not just its content.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="figure-captions" data-text="Figure captions">Figure captions</h3>
			<p>Figure captions are concise and comprehensive summaries of a figure or image.
			</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Use the form "&lt;b&gt;Figure <var translate="no">NUMBER</var>.&lt;/b&gt;
			<var translate="no">DESCRIPTION</var>".</li>
			  <li>Use punctuation in figure captions.</li>
			  <li>When you refer to a figure, don't use spatial descriptions such as "the
			image below." Instead, mention it by number. For example: "... as shown in
			figure 1." Don't capitalize the word <i>figure</i> in a reference to a figure,
			except at the start of a sentence.</li>
			  <li>Don't include the figure caption in a sentence referencing the
			figure.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="figure-descriptions" data-text="Figure descriptions">Figure descriptions</h3>
			<p>A figure description is text that provides a more detailed explanation of information
			represented by a figure. Any new information should be conveyed through text, and not introduced in
			a figure or image.</p>
			<p>The figure description should not be confused with the
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-TECHS/H45.html">longdesc</a></code> attribute, which can
			be used to provide a more lengthy description of the content and context of an image than can be
			conveyed in the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">alt</code> attribute's recommended 155 character limit.</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Create text that conveys the same information as the figure.</li>
			  <li>Use when a figure caption doesn't convey the purpose or complete information of the figure.</li>
			  <li>Use punctuation in figure descriptions.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="text-in-figures" data-text="Text in figures">Text in figures</h3>
			<p> In most cases, avoid embedding explanatory text in screenshot graphics; text
			that's incorporated into a graphic hurts accessibility and searchability, and
			increases localization costs if figures are localized. If you must embed text in
			an image, then be sure to also provide the same information in a form that
			people with visual disabilities can use, such as a figure description.</p>
			<p>When you must include text in figures and images, use the following
			guidelines:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Keep text brief. Avoid complete sentences and punctuation when
			possible.</li>
			  <li>Don't embed figure descriptions or captions in the figure or image.
			Instead, put figure descriptions and captions in text following the figure.</li>
			  <li>Don't create new abbreviations to condense text.</li>
			  <li>Use sentence case. Follow guidelines for <a href="/style/capitalization#capitalization-in-titles-and-headings_1">capitalization
			for titles and headings</a>.</li>
			  <li>Use numbered callouts in figures to help you write a figure description,
			but don't use callouts for detailed annotations.</li>
			  <li><p>Use full trademarked product names.</p>

			<h2 id="high-resolution-images" data-text="High-resolution images">High-resolution images</h2>
			<p>Modern browsers can use high-resolution images if they are available; this
			makes the images look better on high-resolution displays.</p>
			<p>To provide a high-resolution image, use the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">&lt;img&gt;</code>
			element's <code translate="no" dir="ltr">srcset</code> attribute in addition to the standard
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">src</code> attribute. The <code translate="no" dir="ltr">srcset</code> attribute lets you specify
			different image assets for different screen resolutions. It accepts a
			comma-delimited set of image URLs, with the target screen resolution specified
			by a size qualifier: <code translate="no" dir="ltr">1x</code> meaning the "standard" resolution,
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">2x</code> meaning "double" the resolution, and so on.</p>
			<p>If a web browser supports the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">srcset</code> attribute, it selects an
			image from the specified images that's an appropriate resolution for the current
			display. If the browser doesn't support the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">srcset</code> attribute, it
			uses the image in the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">src</code> attribute. Consequently, you must always
			still include the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">src</code> attribute.</p>
			<p>For example, to provide both a standard resolution image and a
			double-resolution image, add a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">srcset</code> attribute and specify both
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">1x</code> and <code translate="no" dir="ltr">2x</code> image assets:</p>
			<devsite-code data-copy-event-label=""><pre class="" translate="no" dir="ltr" is-upgraded=""><span class="tag">&lt;img</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="atn">src</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"/assets/images/skateboard.png"</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><b><span class="atn">srcset</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"/assets/images/skateboard.png 1x,<br>&nbsp; /assets/images/skateboard_2x.png 2x"</span></b><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span class="atn">width</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"375"</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="atn">alt</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">""</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="tag">/&gt;</span><span class="pln"><br></span></pre></devsite-code>
			<ul>
			  <li>The <code translate="no" dir="ltr">width</code> attribute matches the CSS pixel size used for the
			page dimensions. (The height is automatically calculated based on the width and
			the image's proportions; <em>don't</em> state it explicitly.)





			  </li>
			  <li>Set the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">src</code> attribute to point to the standard-resolution
			(<code translate="no" dir="ltr">1x</code>) image, <em>not</em> the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">2x</code> version. (Almost
			everyone who has a high-resolution screen also has a modern browser that can
			recognize the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">srcset</code> attribute. The <code translate="no" dir="ltr">src</code> attribute is
			mainly used by older browsers on low-resolution devices, which should download
			the smaller, low-resolution image.) Even if your original image is the
			higher-resolution image, set the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">src</code> attribute to use the
			standard-resolution version; don't force a reader using a low-resolution screen
			to download a graphic that's higher-resolution than they can view.</li>
			  <li>The filename for the double-resolution image (in this case,
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">skateboard_2x.png</code>) can be anything—it's the "<code translate="no" dir="ltr">&nbsp;2x</code>"
			value following the filename that informs the browser which resolution the file
			is. But it's a good idea to use a filename of the form
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><var translate="no">BASENAME</var>_2x.<var translate="no">EXTENSION</var></code> to make clear to human
			readers that it's a double-resolution version of
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr"><var translate="no">BASENAME</var>.<var translate="no">EXTENSION</var></code>.</li>
			  <li>The double-resolution image must be exactly twice the width and height of
			the standard image, give or take a pixel. (For example, it's okay for the
			double-resolution image to be 875x500 and the standard size to be 438x250.)</li>
			  <li>Don't scale up an existing <code translate="no" dir="ltr">1x</code> image to make the
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">2x</code> version. If all you have is the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">1x</code> version, then
			use it alone. But if you're starting with a high-resolution image (at
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">2x</code> resolution or better), then you can scale it down to appropriate
			dimensions for <code translate="no" dir="ltr">1x</code> and <code translate="no" dir="ltr">2x</code>.</li>
			  <li>Currently, only an additional <code translate="no" dir="ltr">2x</code> image is necessary, but
			someday screen <abbr data-title="pixels per inch">PPI</abbr> may increase further.
			So the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">srcset</code> attribute supports further alternative sizes, each
			specified by the appropriate multiplier, such as <code translate="no" dir="ltr">3x</code> or
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">4x</code>.</li>
			  <li>A browser that supports the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">srcset</code> attribute uses only the
			images provided in that attribute—it ignores the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">src</code> attribute. So
			specify all available image resolutions in the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">srcset</code>
			attribute.</li>
			</ul>

			<aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you frequently revise an image, then you can
			use the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">2x</code> image for both the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">src</code> and
			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">srcset</code> attributes, rather than maintaining multiple sizes of the
			image. If things stabilize and you no longer need to revise the image, then you
			can add a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">1x</code> version.</aside>

			<code translate="no" dir="ltr">style</code> attribute or other workarounds to control the image's
			left/right justification or the margins around the image.</li>





			  <li>Don't make your image too small. It's fine for an image to take up the

			  <li><p>In general, don't use an image that's wider than the column it appears

			than that. In that context, the high-resolution 2x version of the image should

			    <ul>
			      <li>Screenshots at full resolution often take up too much space on the

			      <li>If the graphics were created by someone else (for example, a designer
